If you don't want to carry a port number when you access a site with a domain name, then nginx/apache/caddy must be started as sudo.\n\n2. Installation and uninstallation of software in MacPorts\n\nMacPorts installs and uninstalls software, which must be installed using sudo.\n\n3. Reading and writing configuration files for software installed by MacPorts\n\nMacPorts installs software that requires sudu to read and write files. For example, the php.ini configuration file for php.\n\n4. DNS Server\n\nThe DNS server uses port 53 by default, and since it is smaller than 1024, it must also be started with a sudo command.\n\nThese are computer system limits, all applications of the same type, ask for permission, PhpWebStudy is no different from any other application.",
